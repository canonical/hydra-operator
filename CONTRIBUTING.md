# Contributing

## Overview

This document explains the processes and practices recommended for contributing enhancements to
this operator.

- Generally, before developing bugs or enhancements to this charm, you should [open an issue
  ](https://github.com/canonical/hydra-operator/issues) explaining your use case.
- If you would like to chat with us about charm development, you can reach
  us at [Canonical Mattermost public channel](https://chat.charmhub.io/charmhub/channels/charm-dev)
  or [Discourse](https://discourse.charmhub.io/).
- Familiarising yourself with the [Charmed Operator Framework](https://juju.is/docs/sdk) library
  will help you a lot when working on new features or bug fixes.
- All enhancements require review before being merged. Code review typically examines
  - code quality
  - test coverage
  - user experience for Juju administrators of this charm.
- Please help us out in ensuring easy to review branches by rebasing your pull request branch onto
  the `main` branch. This also avoids merge commits and creates a linear Git commit history.
